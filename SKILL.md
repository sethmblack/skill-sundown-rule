# Sundown Rule

Respond to every request—from customers, partners, or team members—by the end of the same day. Speed and responsiveness compound into trust.

**Token Budget:** ~400 tokens
**Source Expert:** Sam Walton

---

## When to Use

- Building trust with customers or partners
- Improving team responsiveness
- Creating service culture
- "How do I differentiate on responsiveness?"
- "How do I build trust quickly?"
- When service feels slow or unresponsive

---



## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |



## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Sam Walton's Philosophy

At Walmart, the Sundown Rule meant: answer every request by sundown on the day it's received. No exceptions. Customers, suppliers, associates—everyone got same-day responses.

**Why it works:**
- Speed signals respect
- Responsiveness compounds into trust
- Problems don't fester overnight
- Sets expectations that stick

---

## The Rule

**Core commitment:** Every request gets a response by end of day.

Not necessarily a *resolution*—but always an *acknowledgment* and *next step*.

### What Counts as a Response

| Request Type | Minimum Response | Better Response |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Question | "Got it, will research and reply by [date]" | Answer the question |
| Problem | "Acknowledged, looking into it now" | Problem + proposed solution |
| Request | "Received, here's what happens next" | Completed request |
| Complaint | "I hear you, here's what I'm doing" | Apology + resolution |

### What Doesn't Count

- Auto-replies ("We received your message")
- Passing the buck without ownership
- "I'll get back to you" with no timeline
- Silence

---

## Implementation

### For Individuals

1. **Check messages at fixed times** - Morning, midday, end of day minimum
2. **Triage immediately** - Can I respond now? When will I?
3. **Set a daily alarm** - 4 PM reminder to clear queue
4. **Block "response time"** - Dedicated slots for same-day replies

### For Teams

1. **Make it explicit** - "Our standard is same-day response"
2. **Define what counts** - Clear criteria for acknowledgment vs. resolution
3. **Measure it** - Track response times, celebrate success
4. **Cover each other** - If you're out, someone responds for you

### For Organizations

1. **Hire for it** - Screen for responsiveness mindset
2. **Train on it** - Make it part of onboarding
3. **Reward it** - Recognize people who exemplify the standard
4. **Model it** - Leaders must follow the same rule

## Common Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I don't have time" | Responding takes less time than explaining delays |
| "It sets unrealistic expectations" | It sets *clear* expectations—people know where they stand |
| "Some things need research" | Acknowledgment now, answer later—that's still same-day |
| "What about weekends?" | Weekday requests by EOD; weekend requests by Monday EOD |
| "What if the answer is no?" | "No" by sundown is better than "maybe" by never |

---

## The Compound Effect

**Week 1:** People notice you're responsive
**Month 1:** People prefer working with you
**Month 6:** Responsiveness becomes your reputation
**Year 1:** Trust creates opportunities others don't get

Sam Walton built billion-dollar supplier relationships on this principle. Vendors knew Walmart would respond. That reliability became a competitive advantage.

## Self-Assessment

Rate yourself honestly:

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| Did every request from yesterday get a response? | | |
| Does everyone who contacts me know I'll reply same-day? | | |
| Do I have a system to catch requests before EOD? | | |
| When I can't resolve something, do I acknowledge anyway? | | |

If any answer is "No," start there.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:**
- input_data: [Specific example input]
- context: [Relevant background]

**Output:**

[Detailed demonstration of the skill in action - showing the complete process and final result]

**Why this works:**
This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill by [explanation of what makes it effective].

## Integration

This skill embodies Sam Walton's operational discipline. It pairs with:
- **frontline-intelligence** - Respond to frontline input same-day
- Any customer service or trust-building initiative
